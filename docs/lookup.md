# `aws-sso-util admin lookup` and `aws-sso-util admin assignments`
The AWS SSO APIs leave a lot to be desired when it comes to searching and listing items.
These two utilities help deal with that.

# `aws-sso-util admin lookup`
The AWS SSO APIs and CloudFormation resources require the use of identifiers that are not displayed in the console, and that the APIs do not make easy to look up by name.
`aws-sso-util admin lookup` is provided to make this a little easier.

| Item                    | Syntax                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| AWS SSO instance        | `aws-sso-util admin lookup instance`                          |
| AWS SSO identity store  | `aws-sso-util admin lookup identity-store`                    |
| Groups                  | `aws-sso-util admin lookup groups GROUP_NAME [GROUP_NAME...]` |
| Users                   | `aws-sso-util admin lookup users USER_NAME [USER_NAME...]`    |
| Permission sets         | `aws-sso-util admin lookup permission-sets NAME [NAME...]`    |

For instance and identity store, it just prints out the id.
For the others, it displays the instance/identity store id being used, and then a list of the names with their identifiers.
You can control the field separator with `--sep` (e.g., to output a CSV).

By default, any names not found will have `NOT_FOUND` as their identifier, but with `--error-if-not-found`/`-e` it will exit with an error at the first name not found.

For group/user/permission set lookups, the instance/identity store will be automatically retrieved if you do not provide `--instance-arn` (for permission sets) or `--instance-store-id` (for groups and users).
After the first lookup, the instance and identity store will be cached in `~/.aws/cli/cache` in a file prefixed `aws-sso-util-ids-`, with a suffix corresponding to the profile in use or the account+region.
By default, the ids will not be printed when they are looked up; you can display them `--show-id`.

## Shortcuts

Because AWS SSO APIs require the instance ARN, I find these shell functions handy to put in your `.bashrc`/`.profile`:
```bash
sso-ins() {
    aws-sso-util admin lookup instance "$@"
}

sso-ins-id() {
    aws-sso-util admin lookup instance "$@" | sed "s/arn:aws:sso:::instance\///g"
}

sso-store() {
    aws-sso-util admin lookup identity-store "$@"
}

sso-ps() {
    _PS=$1
    shift
    _INS=$(aws-sso-util admin lookup instance "$@" | sed "s/arn:aws:sso:::instance\///g")
    echo arn:aws:sso:::permission-set/arn:aws:sso:::permissionSet/$_INS/$_PS
}
```

You can then use it like:
```
$ aws sso-admin describe-permission-set --instance-arn $(sso-ins) --permission-set-arn $(sso-ps ps-fd6a454dd00d9c28)
```

# `aws-sso-util admin assignments`
There is no simple API for retrieving all assignments or even a decent subset.
The current best you can do is [list all the users with a particular PermissionSet on a particular account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/APIReference/API_ListAccountAssignments.html).

`aws-sso-util` takes care of this, by [looping over all the accounts in your organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/APIReference/API_ListAccounts.html), then [over all the permission sets in each account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/APIReference/API_ListPermissionSetsProvisionedToAccount.html) and then [over all principals with that permission set in that account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/APIReference/API_ListAccountAssignments.html).

For group/user/permission set lookups, the instance/identity store will be automatically retrieved if you do not provide `--instance-arn` (for permission sets) or `--instance-store-id` (for groups and users).
By default, the ids will not be printed when they are looked up; you can display them `--show-id`.

The output is a CSV-formatted list of the assignments with the following columns:
* Instance ARN
* Principal type (`GROUP` or `USER`)
* Principal id
* Principal name, if it can be found, or `UNKNOWN` otherwise
* PermissionSet ARN
* PermissionSet name
* Target type (`AWS_ACCOUNT`)
* Target id (account number)
* Target name (account name)

You can filter the list by providing the following options.
For a given parameter, providing multiple values is an OR operation; combining multiple parameters is AND.

`--group`/`-g` and `--user`/`-u` can be the full id, or a regex pattern to match against the name.

`--permission-set` can be the ARN, or the full id (everything after the first slash in the ARN) or the short id (after the last slash), or a regex to match against the permission set name.

`--account-id` can be a string that matches either the beginning or the end of the AWS account number.

`--account-name` is a regex to match against the account name.

`-a` is shorthand and can take values for either `--account-id` or `--account-name`.

`--ou` can be an Organizations OU id or root id, which will use all the accounts directly in the OU, or recursively in child OUs as well if the `--ou-recursive` flag is added.

You can control the field separator

By default, the names for every principal, permission set, and target are looked up.
To eliminate this step from the process, use `--no-lookup-names`.
Names for accounts will still appear if you have not specified specific accounts, because the names are available when enumerating accounts in Organizations anyway.
