Currently, the GitHub repo serves as the documentation for `aws-sso-util` and `aws-sso-lib`, which means `master` needs to stay close to the published version of the code.
For this reason, **please open your pull requests against the `next` branch.**
The `next` branch gets merged to `master` when creating a release.
Ideally the documentation should live on, say, [readthedocs.org](https://readthedocs.org/), but I have not gotten to that yet.
